To Do
=====

The following are a list of planned enhancements for this project:

Documentation
-------------

- Greatly simplify README and API documents into HTML documentation and host on SourceForge
- Convert text documents to Markdown

API
---

- Use an RDF vocabulary to describe query mixes instead of current text file
	- Allows for marking queries to be included multiple times
	- Allows for adding user friendly name
- When the same query occurs multiple times in a mix the results are not currently amalgamated. It would be nice if
  the tool was capable of automatically doing this
- RdfProgressListener
	- Generate an RDF form output, define a vocabulary for this
	- Add a --rdf flag to set this file for benchmark command
- Lag Compensation
	- Try to calculate how much delay in HTTP communications there is with the endpoint via simple GETs to the endpoint
	- Adjust all values for the endpoint by this delay
- XSLT Stylesheets for rendering XML results in usable form in browsers
- GSP Operation support
- In-memory operation support
	- i.e. allow for benchmarking without using HTTP
