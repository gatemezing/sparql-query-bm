The following are a list of planned enhancements for this project:

- Use an RDF vocabulary to describe query mixes instead of current text file
	- Allows for marking queries to be included multiple times
	- Allows for adding user friendly names
	
- RdfProgressListener
	- Generate an RDF form output, define a vocabulary for this
	- Add a --rdf flag to set this file
	
- Revise command line argument names
	- The -f/--file flag should become -c/--csv
	
- Don't require files/no output flag to be set for each standard listener, simply require at least one listener setting

- Lag Compensation
	- Try to calculate how much delay in HTTP communications there is with the endpoint via simple GETs to the endpoint
	- Adjust all values for the endpoint by this delay
	
- XSLT Stylesheets for rendering XML results in browser
